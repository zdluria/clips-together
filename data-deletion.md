# Data Deletion Instructions

## How to Delete Your Data

Our application, Clips Together, provides these methods for you to delete your data:

### Option 1: Revoke Access Through Facebook

The simplest way to ensure we no longer have access to your data is to revoke our app's permissions:

1. Go to [Facebook Settings > Apps and Websites](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications)
2. Find Clips Together in the list of connected apps
3. Click the "Remove" button

### What Gets Deleted

- All access tokens associated with your account
- Any cached page information or content metadata
- Connection records between your account and our application

### Data Retention Policy
